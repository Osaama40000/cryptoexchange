<p>Your account is now protected with an additional layer of security. You'll need to enter a code from your authenticator app each time you log in.</p>

<div class="security-notice">
    <p>🔐 <strong>Important:</strong> Make sure you've saved your backup codes in a safe place. You'll need them if you lose access to your authenticator app.</p>
</div>

<p>Thank you for keeping your account secure!</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>The CryptoExchange Security Team</p>
